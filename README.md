# chef_git_spike

This cookbook / test machine is to be used to validate various configurations of the git chef resource. While the documetation is addequate, I needed some concrete examples.

# Using 

While the cookbook is pretty simple, it works in conjuction with the git repository and the structure of the git repository. I'm still not 100% sure this will work the way I expect it to. I may start using a seperate git repsository to download.

# Modifying 

will figure out the rules as I go.
